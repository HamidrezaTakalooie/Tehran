    <h1>History</h1>
    <p>Archaeological remains from the ancient city of Ray suggest that settlement in Tehran dates back over 6,000
      years. Tehran was a village outside the ancient Ray.</p>
    <p>In the ninth century, Tehran was a well-known village, but less so than the city of Rhages, flourishing nearby.
      Rhages was described in detail by tenth-century Muslim geographers.]Despite the interest that Arabian Baghdad
      displayed in Rhages, the number of Arabs in the city remained insignificant and the population mainly consisted of
      Iranians of all classes.</p>
    <p>The Oghuz Turks invaded Rhages in 1035 and again in 1042, but the city was recovered under the Seljuks and the
      Khwarezmians. Medieval writer Najm od Din Razi declared the population of Rhages about 500,000 before the Mongol
      invasion. In the 13th century, the Mongols invaded Rhages, laid the city to ruins, and massacred many of its
      inhabitants.Others escaped to Tehran.</p>
    <p>Growing awareness of civil rights resulted in the Constitutional Revolution and the first constitution of Iran in
      1906. On June 2, 1907, the parliament passed a law on local governance known as the Baladie (municipal law),
      providing a detailed outline of issues such as the role of councils within the city, the members' qualifications,
      the election process, and the requirements to be entitled to vote. The then-Qajar monarch Mohammad Ali abolished
      the constitution and bombarded the parliament with the help of the Russian-controlled Cossack Brigade on June 23,
      1908. That was followed by the capture of the city by the revolutionary forces of Ali-Qoli Khan (Sardar Asad II)
      and Mohammad Vali Khan (Sepahsalar e Tonekaboni) on July 13, 1909. As a result, the monarch was exiled and
      replaced by his son Ahmad, and the parliament was re-established</p>
