    <h1>Tehran</h1>
    <p>Tehran is the capital and largest city of Iran, also serving as the capital of the Province, County and the
      Central District. With a population of around 9.4 million in the city, and 16.8 million in the metropolitan area,
      Tehran is the most populous city in Iran and Western Asia, the second-largest metropolitan area in the West Asia,
      and the 24th most populous metropolitan area in the world.</p>
    <div>
      <p>The metropolis of Tehran is divided into 22 municipal districts, each with its own administrative center. Of
        the 22 municipal districts, 20 are located in Tehran County's Central District, while districts 1 and 20 are
        respectively located in the counties of Shemiranat and Ray. Although administratively separate, the cities of
        Ray and Shemiran are often considered part of Greater Tehran.</p>
    </div>


    <p>s the city has a large area, with significant differences in elevation among various districts, the weather is
      often cooler in the hilly north than in the flat southern part of Tehran. For instance, the 17.3 km (10.7 mi)
      Valiasr Street runs from Tehran's railway station at 1,117 m (3,665 ft) elevation above sea level in the south
      of the city to Tajrish Square at 1712.6 m (5612.3 ft) elevation above sea level in the north. However, the
      elevation can even rise up to 2,000 m (6,600 ft) at the end of Velenjak in northern Tehran.</p>
